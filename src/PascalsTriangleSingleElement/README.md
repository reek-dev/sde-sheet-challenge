Pascal's triangle looks as follows

```
[1] 1
[2] 1 1
[3] 1 2 1
[4] 1 3 3 1
[5] 1 4 6 4 1
```
**Problem:** Given the row and column number (1-based) of the triangle, print that particular element

**Solution:**

To find the element with a given row and column number, we use the combination formula $\binom{n}{k}$
